<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Racing Roots, RC Cars to Karting:</strong><br>Lewis Hamilton's introduction to motorsport began with remote-controlled (RC) cars, which he raced competitively and even became the runner-up in a national RC racing championship at the age of six. Recognizing his talent, his father Anthony, pondered whether Lewis's skills in RC racing could transfer to full-size motorsport. This curiosity set the stage for Hamilton's transition to karting and marked the beginning of his journey in competitive racing.</p><a href="images/hamrc.jpeg" data-lightbox="images" data-title="caption 1"><img src="images/hamrc.jpeg" alt="hamilton in RC race"></a>

<p class="scroll-s"><strong>The Pact, Journey from Autograph to F1 Dream:</strong><br>At their initial encounter, Ron Dennis inscribed in Lewis Hamilton's autograph book, "Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then." True to the promise, in 1998, Hamilton, at the age of 13, became the youngest driver ever to be officially signed to the McLaren Driver Development Support program. This landmark contract not only provided financial and technical backing but also held the potential for a future entry into Formula One.</p><img src="images/hamden.jpeg" alt="hamilton with dennis">

<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Accelerating Ambitions, Rise in Junior Karting:</strong><br>Progressing to the Junior Intercontinental A level in 1998, Lewis Hamilton secured a remarkable second-place finish in the McLaren Mercedes Champions of the Future. His talents extended to the Italian Open Championship, where he claimed a notable fourth position.

<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Revving Up, Transition to Formula Renault:</strong><br>Formula Renault served as Lewis Hamilton's entry point into car racing, concluding his successful karting chapter. Despite a rocky start during his first test with Manor Motorsport, where he crashed the Formula Renault at Mallory Park after only three laps, Hamilton's resilience and speed stood out. Unfazed by the incident, he quickly adapted, impressing McLaren with his ability to rebound and perform under pressure.</p><img src="images/formularenault.jpeg" alt="hamilton in formula 4 racing">

<div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>The Triumph, From Third to Dominance in Formula Renault:</strong><br>After a promising fifth-place finish in the British Formula Renault Winter Series, Lewis Hamilton entered the full championship in 2002. Despite facing competition from more experienced drivers like Danny Watts, Hamilton secured three wins, finishing third overall. The following year showcased Hamilton’s true prowess as he claimed his first victory in the fifth round at Silverstone. From there, he dominated, winning all but one of the next ten races. Hamilton secured the championship with an impressive tally of ten wins, nine fastest laps, eleven pole positions, and 419 points, outclassing runner-up Alex Lloyd with 371 points, even allowing him to miss the last two races.</p><img src="images/frchamp.jpeg" alt="hamilton holding his formula renault championship">

<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Resilience and Triumph, Formula Three Journey:</strong><br>Lewis Hamilton faced adversity in the final round of the British Formula Three championship with Manor, encountering a crash that led to his hospitalization despite strong qualifying. Undeterred, he returned to Formula Three in 2004, shifting to the Euroseries with Manor. Hamilton secured a victory at the Norising street track, finishing fifth overall behind champions like Jamie Green and future F1 drivers Alexandre Premat, Nicolas Lapierre, and Nico Rosberg. The same year brought additional victories in the Bahrain F3 Superprix and race one of the Macau F3 Grand Prix.

Remarkably, he won 15 out of 20 races, securing a 16th victory at Spa-Francorchamps (later disqualified for a technical infringement). Hamilton outperformed teammate Adrian Sutil. The same year, he triumphed at the F3 Marlboro Masters in Zandvoort, Netherlands, clinched both Monaco F3 Grand Prix races and both Pau F3 Grand Prix races, all from pole position.

  <p class="scroll-s"><strong>F1 Debut:</strong><br>In 2007, McLaren faced a vacant slot alongside Fernando Alonso. Surprising many, including the departure of experienced drivers Raikkonen and Montoya, team principal Ron Dennis chose rookie Lewis Hamilton over seasoned competitors like de la Rosa and Paffett. The decision, kept under wraps until November 24th, aimed to avoid overshadowing Michael Schumacher’s retirement. Dennis cited Hamilton’s long-standing association with McLaren and his deserving talent as the key factors behind the unconventional choice. Hamilton’s Spectacular Debut Season in Formula 1 catapulted him to instant fame. Remarkably, he secured a podium finish in his very first race and maintained this impressive streak for nine consecutive races. His outstanding performance included notable victories in Montreal and Indianapolis, showcasing his exceptional talent early in his career, eventually finishing second in the Drivers’ Championship.</p> <img src="images/firstRace.jpeg" alt="first race for Lewis Hamilton in F1"></div>
<br>
     <div class="imgS">
  <p class="scroll-s"><strong>First F1 Win:</strong><br>Lewis Hamilton's first Formula 1 Grand Prix victory occurred on June 10, 2007, at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Canada. He was driving for the McLaren-Mercedes team during the Canadian Grand Prix. This win marked a significant milestone in Hamilton's career as it was his sixth race in Formula 1, and this victory was a precursor to his subsequent successes in the sport.</p> <img src="images/firstWin.jpeg" alt="first win for lewis hamilton"></div>
<br>

     <div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>First F1 Championship:</strong><br> Staying with McLaren in 2008, Hamilton faced challenges with Alonso’s departure and Kovalainen’s arrival. Despite a disappointing loss in the 2007 championship, Hamilton started the new season strong, winning the opener in Melbourne. However, his second season saw lapses in composure, marked by serious mistakes in Bahrain, Canada, France, and Japan. Amidst these struggles, Hamilton showcased brilliance in rain-soaked races, notably dominating at Silverstone. Controversies surrounded him, with five penalties throughout the season, including a post-race disqualification at Spa. Overcoming setbacks, he triumphed in China, setting the stage for a nail-biting title showdown in Interlagos. Hamilton’s ultra-conservative strategy secured the championship by a single point, marking a dramatic end to the season, becoming the youngest World Champion at that time.</p><img src="images/firstchampionship.jpeg" alt="hamilton holding his first championship">

<br>
<div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Challenges and Redemption, 2009:</strong><br>Facing a slow start with the MP4-24, McLaren struggled in the 2009 season, making it clear early on that Hamilton wouldn’t defend his title. Complications escalated when they were accused of deception during the first race, leading to Hamilton’s disqualification and a public apology in Malaysia. The car’s performance improved significantly in the latter half of the season, allowing Hamilton to secure victories in Hungary and Singapore. Despite the initial setbacks, he finished the year in a commendable fifth place in the championship, trailing behind the dominant Brawn and Red Bull drivers.</p><img src="images/hamf12009.jpeg" alt="F1 car of lewis hamilton 2009 on track">

<div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Resilience in 2010, Pursuit for Championship Glory:</strong><br>Equipped with the competitive MP4-25, Hamilton made a strong comeback in the 2010 season. Leading at the halfway mark with victories in Turkey and Canada, he secured a third win in Belgium. However, setbacks in Italy and Singapore, where collisions ended his races, posed challenges to his championship campaign. Despite staying in contention until the final round and finishing second, Hamilton concluded the season in fourth place in the championship. His resilient performance showcased his determination to vie for championship glory.</p><img src="images/hamf12010.jpeg" alt="hamilton in 2010 f1 car">

<br>
<div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Struggles in 2011, Wins Amidst Turmoil:</strong><br>In the 2011 Formula 1 season dominated by Vettel, Hamilton faced a tumultuous campaign marked by errors and incidents. Despite the scrappiness, he clinched three victories. Beginning with promise in Melbourne, where he secured second place, Hamilton faced challenges with the new MP4-26 and encountered unnecessary incidents throughout the season. While he showcased moments of brilliance, such as a consummate victory in Germany, Hamilton often found himself in collisions and controversies. Button’s ability to extract similar performance from the Pirelli tires with less wear became evident. Despite finishing the season behind his teammate and facing penalties from the stewards, Hamilton’s resilience shone through in select moments of racing excellence.</p><img src="images/hamf12011.jpeg" alt="hamilton celebrating in yas marina 2011">

<br>
<div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Challenges and Transition in 2012 Season with McLaren:</strong><br>Despite the MP4-27’s competitiveness in 2012, Hamilton’s season was marred by reliability issues and operational errors, taking him out of realistic championship contention early on. Struggling to convert pole positions into victories, he faced setbacks, including starting from the back in Spa after running out of fuel in qualifying. While Hamilton secured wins in Canada, Hungary, Italy, and America, he often found himself out of the points due to circumstances beyond his control. As his five-year deal with McLaren approached its end, speculation about his future intensified. Surprising many, Hamilton announced his departure from McLaren after the Singapore Grand Prix, signaling a significant move to join Mercedes.</p><img src="images/hamf12012.jpeg" alt="hamilton in f1 2012 car with mclaren">

  <p class="scroll-s"><strong>F1 Mercedes Era:</strong><br>This partnership proved to be immensely successful, with Hamilton clinching multiple Drivers' Championships and contributing to Mercedes' dominance in the Constructors' Championship.</p><img src="images/W04.jpeg" alt="Mercedes W04 formula One Car 2013"></div>
<br>
<div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Strategic Shift in 2013, Transition to Mercedes:</strong><br>In a pivotal move, Hamilton ended prolonged speculation in September by confirming his shift to Mercedes for the 2013 season. This decision proved timely, as Mercedes outperformed McLaren, securing second place in the world championship. While Mercedes won three times that year, Hamilton’s lone victory came in Hungary. Despite facing challenges with tire wear in the first half of the season and struggling with the car’s balance, Hamilton secured pole position five times. Although not entirely satisfied with his car, he narrowly outscored teammate Nico Rosberg in the latter half of the season, marking a solid start to his journey with Mercedes.</p><img src="images/hampod2013.jpeg" alt="Lewis Hamilton on the podium with Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel at the Hungaroring in 2013, and Hamilton’s only win of 2013">

<br>
<div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Triumph Amidst Challenges in 2014 Season with Mercedes:</strong><br>In a season marked by doubts, Hamilton’s move to Mercedes proved wise as the W05 dominated the 2014 championship, securing his second title. However, challenges emerged early with an engine failure in the first race. Despite reclaiming the points lead from Rosberg with four consecutive wins, Monaco saw controversy over a yellow flag incident. Further obstacles arose, including brake failures and car issues in qualifying. Hamilton’s resilience shone as he fought back to win races, notably in Belgium after a puncture incident. The controversial double points finale heightened the title race, but Hamilton’s lead prevailed, securing the championship. A final-race Mercedes reliability problem eliminated Rosberg, cementing Hamilton’s triumphant 2014 season.</p><img src="images/hamf12014.jpeg" alt="Lewis Hamilton celebrating his second Formula 1 world championship win in 2014">

<div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>His Dominance, Securing Back-to-Back Championships in 2015:</strong><br>In 2015, Hamilton not only retained his championship but also equaled Ayrton Senna’s record and surpassed his hero’s win tally. Addressing a previous weakness, Hamilton started from pole position 11 times in the first 12 races, converting most into victories and securing the championship early. Despite a scrappy performance in Hungary and a technical failure for Rosberg in Italy, Hamilton’s advantage in the championship remained. A crucial moment occurred in Russia, where Rosberg faced another breakdown, virtually sealing the championship for Hamilton. An unforced error by Rosberg in the following race solidified Hamilton’s title. Though Rosberg rallied in the next races, winning each from pole position, and Monaco brought an unexpected pit stop disappointment for Hamilton, these were minor setbacks in an overwhelmingly successful campaign.</p><img src="images/ham2015.jpeg" alt="Hamilton saw off Rosberg for another title in 2015">

<br>
<div class="imgS">
<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Champion’s Unfortunate Fall 2016 Season:</strong><br>In a surprising turn of events, Hamilton fell short in retaining his title during his fourth season at Mercedes, despite the team’s consistent performance advantage. Numerous power unit problems and a shocking failure in Malaysia disrupted his season. While Hamilton won ten races, outpacing his teammate, Rosberg’s better reliability and consistent performance proved decisive. Hamilton’s bid for the title in the final races required wins and Rosberg’s absence from the podium, an unlikely scenario. Ultimately, Rosberg secured the championship, and his subsequent departure from the sport added another twist to the 2016 F1 season.</p><img src="images/ham2016.jpeg" alt="Rosberg beat Hamilton to the 2016 title and shaking hands on podium">
