Recognizing his talent, his father Anthony, pondered whether Lewis's skills in RC racing could transfer to full-size motorsport. This curiosity set the stage for Hamilton's transition to karting and marked the beginning of his journey in competitive racing.</p><img src="images/hamrc.jpeg" alt="hamilton in RC race">
