  <p class="scroll-s"><strong>F1 Debut:</strong><br>In 2007, McLaren faced a vacant slot alongside Fernando Alonso. Surprising many, including the departure of experienced drivers Raikkonen and Montoya, team principal Ron Dennis chose rookie Lewis Hamilton over seasoned competitors like de la Rosa and Paffett.

Dennis cited Hamilton’s long-standing association with McLaren and his deserving talent as the key factors behind the unconventional choice.

However, his second season saw lapses in composure, marked by serious mistakes in Bahrain, Canada, France, and Japan. Amidst these struggles, Hamilton showcased brilliance in rain-soaked races, notably dominating at Silverstone. Controversies surrounded him, with five penalties throughout the season, including a post-race disqualification at Spa.

<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Triumph Amidst Challenges in 2014 Season with Mercedes:</strong><br>In a season marked by doubts, Hamilton’s move to Mercedes proved wise as the W05 dominated the 2014 championship, securing his second title. However, challenges emerged early with an engine failure in the first race. Despite reclaiming the points lead from Rosberg with four consecutive wins, Monaco saw controversy over a yellow flag incident. Further obstacles arose, including brake failures and car issues in qualifying. Hamilton’s resilience shone as he fought back to win races, notably in Belgium after a puncture incident. The controversial double points finale heightened the title race, but Hamilton’s lead prevailed, securing the championship. A final-race Mercedes reliability problem eliminated Rosberg, cementing Hamilton’s triumphant 2014 season.</p><a href="images/hamf12014.jpeg" data-lightbox="images" data-title="Lewis Hamilton celebrating his second Formula 1 world championship win in 2014"><img src="images/hamf12014.jpeg" alt="Lewis Hamilton celebrating his second Formula 1 world championship win in 2014"></a>

Despite a scrappy performance in Hungary and a technical failure for Rosberg in Italy, Hamilton’s advantage in the championship remained. A crucial moment occurred in Russia, where Rosberg faced another breakdown, virtually sealing the championship for Hamilton. An unforced error by Rosberg in the following race solidified Hamilton’s title. Though Rosberg rallied in the next races, winning each from pole position, and Monaco brought an unexpected pit stop disappointment for Hamilton, these were minor setbacks in an overwhelmingly successful campaign.</p><a href="images/ham2015.jpeg" data-lightbox="images" data-title="Hamilton saw off Rosberg for another title in 2015"><img src="images/ham2015.jpeg" alt="Hamilton saw off Rosberg for another title in 2015"></a>

<p class="scroll-s"><strong>Champion’s Unfortunate Fall 2016 Season:</strong><br>In a surprising turn of events, Hamilton fell short in retaining his title during his fourth season at Mercedes, despite the team’s consistent performance advantage. Numerous power unit problems and a shocking failure in Malaysia disrupted his season. While Hamilton won ten races, outpacing his teammate, Rosberg’s better reliability and consistent performance proved decisive. Hamilton’s bid for the title in the final races required wins and Rosberg’s absence from the podium, an unlikely scenario. Ultimately, Rosberg secured the championship, and his subsequent departure from the sport added another twist to the 2016 F1 season.</p><a href="images/ham2016.jpeg" data-lightbox="images" data-title="Rosberg beat Hamilton to the 2016 title and shaking hands on podium"><img src="images/ham2016.jpeg" alt="Rosberg beat Hamilton to the 2016 title and shaking hands on podium"></a>
